# Maji_Ndogo_Water_Crisis
This repository contains a full-scale data analysis project using SQL to address a water crisis. I handled the entire process, from data cleaning and validation to generating actionable insights and a project plan for engineering teams. The analysis transformed over 60,000 records into a clear, data-driven strategy for improving water access.
