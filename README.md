# Data-Driven Solutions for a Water Crisis: An SQL Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on a complete data analysis workflow, from raw data to actionable insights, to solve a real-world water crisis in the fictional Maji Ndogo region. Using advanced SQL, I transformed a massive, messy dataset of over 60,000 records into a clear, prioritized project plan to help engineers improve water access for communities in need.

## Problem Statement

The Maji Ndogo local government needed to identify and address critical water supply issuesâ€”specifically, contaminated sources, broken infrastructure, and long queue times at shared taps. The goal was to provide a data-driven strategy to guide engineering teams, ensuring resources are allocated to the areas with the greatest need.

## Methodology

The analysis was performed using SQL, following a structured, step-by-step process:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Exploration:** Initial queries were used to inspect the database, identify inconsistencies in data collection, and correct data quality issues.
2.  **Integrated Analysis:** I used `JOIN`s, `CASE` statements, and `GROUP BY` to analyze key areas, including:
    * Identifying corrupt data entries and employee performance issues.
    * Analyzing queue times at shared taps to determine where new taps are needed.
    * Assessing well pollution and water quality across the region.
3.  **Creating a Final Project Plan:** The final stage involved creating a professional `Project_progress` table, which serves as a prioritized backlog for engineers. This table includes specific improvement suggestions for each location.

All SQL queries used in this analysis can be found in the [SQL_Scripts/maji_ndogo_analysis.sql](https://github.com/Bini-fish/Maji_Ndogo_Water_Crisis/blob/main/SQL_Scripts/maji_ndogo_analysis.sql) file.

## Key Insights & Results

Through this analysis, I delivered a comprehensive project plan that directly addresses the water crisis. The key deliverables included:

* **A Final, Actionable Table:** A cleaned and validated dataset of over **25,000 records**, ready for implementation by the engineering teams.
* **Targeted Improvements:** The plan specifically identified locations that needed improvements, such as drilling new wells for river-dependent communities, installing new taps at high-traffic shared sources, and implementing water purification systems (UV/RO filters) for contaminated wells.
* **Operational Efficiency:** The analysis also identified operational issues, such as poor-performing field surveyors and corrupt data entries, which provided a holistic view of the problem.

## Skills & Tools

* **SQL (MySQL):** Used for all data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling inconsistent data, correcting values, and ensuring data integrity.
* **Data Modeling:** Creating a new table (`Project_progress`) to structure and present the final deliverables.
* **Data Analysis:** Using queries to answer complex business questions and uncover hidden patterns.
